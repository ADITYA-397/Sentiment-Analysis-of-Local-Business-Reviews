# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Local-Business-Reviews

I recently completed a field project titled “Sentiment Analysis of Local Business Reviews” as part of my B.Sc. Computer Science curriculum at D. G. Ruparel College of Arts, Science and Commerce.

In this project, our team analyzed real customer and student feedback for Lost Stories Academy, a music production and DJ school in Mumbai. The goal was simple: understand how people actually feel about a business by turning unstructured reviews into meaningful insights.
